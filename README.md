# (Archived) Vagrant Box for running Docker

**IMPORTANT**: This project is not developed anymore. For Docker I recommend using a virtual machine
created by [multipass](https://multipass.run/) without graphical interface.

This project contains everything to build the Vagrant Box of [itsziget/docker-webdev](https://app.vagrantup.com/itsziget/boxes/docker-webdev).
